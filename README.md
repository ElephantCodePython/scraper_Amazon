# ðŸ›‘ Development Policy, Risk, and Ethical Stance

This repository serves as an **educational project under active development** and is currently in the **Alpha stage**. The codebase is **not complete** and is missing essential final components necessary for production readiness. All development is conducted under strict ethical and legal constraints.

## 1. Deliberate Restriction of Advanced Techniques (Ethical Constraints)

This code **intentionally lacks** anti-blocking tools.

Despite our full familiarity with techniques such as **Rotating Proxies**, **Automated CAPTCHA Solving**, and full **Human Behavior Simulation**, we have consciously decided to refrain from implementing them. Our goal is to demonstrate coding proficiency and technical capability, not to create a tool for violating website terms of service (ToS) or facilitating illegal/commercial activities. This decision is made to maintain the **ethical integrity** of the project and the developer.

## 2. Execution Risk Warning (For End-Users)

While this project is under development, its practical execution is **strongly discouraged**.

Running this code may:
* Result in the **temporary or permanent blocking (IP Block)** of your internet address by the target website's defense mechanisms.
* Expose you to legal and technical risks resulting from the **violation of the target website's Terms of Service (ToS)**.

The responsibility for any practical execution of this code and the ensuing consequences rests **entirely with the end-user.**
